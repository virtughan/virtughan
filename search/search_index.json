We were fascinated by the approach and felt an urge to replicate something similar on our own in an open-source manner. We knew Google uses their own kind of tiling, so we started from there.</p> <p>Initially, we faced a challenge \u2013 how could we generate tiles and compute at the same time without pre-computing the whole dataset? Pre-computation would lead to larger processed data sizes, which we didn\u2019t want. And so, the exploration began and the concept of on the fly tiling computation introduced </p> <p>At university, we were introduced to the concept of data cubes and the advantages of having a time dimension and semantic layers in the data. It seemed fascinating, despite the challenge of maintaining terabytes of satellite imagery. We thought \u2013 maybe we could achieve something similar by developing an approach where one doesn\u2019t need to replicate data but can still build a data cube with semantic layers and computation. This raised another challenge \u2013 how to make it work? And hence come the virtual data cube</p> <p>We started converting Sentinel-2 images to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and experimented with the time dimension using Python\u2019s xarray to compute the data. We found that earth-search\u2019s effort to store Sentinel images as COGs made it easier for us to build virtual data cubes across the world without storing any data. This felt like an achievement and proof that modern data cubes should focus on improving computation rather than worrying about how to manage terabytes of data.</p> <p>We wanted to build something to show that this approach actually works and is scalable. We deliberately chose to use only our laptops to run the prototype and process a year\u2019s worth of data without expensive servers.</p> <p>Learn about COG and how to generate one for this project Here</p>"},{"location":"#purpose","title":"Purpose","text":""},{"location":"#1-efficient-on-the-fly-tile-computation","title":"1.

Virtual Computation Cubes: Focusing on Computation","text":"<p>While storing large images can offer some benefits, we believe that placing emphasis on efficient computation yields far greater advantages and effectively removes the need to worry about large-scale image storage. COGs make it possible to analyze images directly without storing the entire dataset. This introduces the idea of virtual computation cubes, where images are stacked and processed over time, allowing for analysis across different layers ( including semantic layers ) without needing to download or save everything. So original data is never replicated. In this setup, a data provider can store and convert images to COGs, while users or service providers focus on calculations.

**Note**: Sentinel2 Image downloader downloads both bands of the full scene and then calculates ndwi. Also Fewa lake is in between the overlap of two images so will take more images altogether. Also,we need to login to the CDSE and we have discarded the image polygons extraction time.
Also, for another plugin, 7 and 12 are derived after calculating time only for 7 and 12 images out of 13 and 14 respectively.
**Times calculation:** minute seconds are converted into seconds and A/B (ie. bigger/smaller)
